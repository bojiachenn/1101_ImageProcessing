1. Porject_1: Histogram Matching

How to solve the problem of Histogram Equalization (HE) with a bright (washed-out) or dark appearance using the technique of Histogram Matching (HM).

Hint: Prepare an image that may cause the problem of HE, e.g., washed-out mentioned above, and reshape the histogram of the image using the HM method so that the refined image can have a normal HE output.


2. Porject_3: Morphological operator implementation using CUDA

Implement the Dilation and Erosion operators on GPU using CUDA. List the source code and the experimental results on your report, and upload the detail documentation.
